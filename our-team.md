<h2>Hi, I'm Luke Terry</h2>
I'm fascinated by the ever-growing landscape of platforms and applications that society depends on. I'm thrilled that my experience as a programmer and as a creative thinker has grown to a point that I can use my mathematical and programming skills to help people like me buy and sell secondhand goods. As a developer in a Fortune 500 company, I learned how to turn an idea into a robust and scalable software product that effectively solves a problem. My enthusiasm for entreprenership and my background in software engineering has uniquely prepared me to create a product like Open Thrift.</p>
