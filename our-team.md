<h2>Hi, I'm Luke Terry</h2>
I'm fascinated by the ever-growing landscape of platforms and applications that society depends on. I'm thrilled that my experience as a programmer and as a creative thinker has grown to a point that I can use my mathematical and programming skills to help people like me buy and sell secondhand goods. As a developer in a Fortune 500 company, I learned how to turn an idea into a robust and scalable software product that effectively solves a problem. My enthusiasm for entreprenership and my background in software engineering has uniquely prepared me to create a product like Open Thrift.

<h2>Hi there, I'm Tyler Roman</h2>
I'm passionate about using my skills as a programmer to improve the safety and quality of life of my peers. As a student myself, I know how hazardous it can be to trade online, which is why we've created Open Thrift. With my unique interst in cyber security as it relates to software development, we hope to create a platform which prioritizes the safety and comfort of the student!
