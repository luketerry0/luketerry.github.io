# Steps to Launch

 - ## Market Research

Is there even a market for a product like this? About a quarter of OU undergraduate students (~5000) are part of a GroupMe or Instagram group dedicated to secondhand sales. These platforms are difficult to use and rife with scammers, but clearly students see value in them that they don't see in established commerce platforms like Facebook Marketplace or Craigslist.

We believe that the reason students put up with these difficult to use platforms is twofold. First, these platforms are entirely free, and secondly, these platforms make it easy to talk to other students. The needs of college students differ significantly from the wider population, so it's easier for college students to use these platforms to buy and sell to other students.

Before we launch, however, it's important that we use surveys and focus groups to dig deeper into the specific needs and preferances of college students.

 - ## Soft Launch

We will launch the app to a smaller group of people to ensure that the app is bug free and caters to the needs of college students.

During this period, we intend to collect feedback about the app and integrate new features that we might not have thought of. This stage of the launch will be an iterative process until we are happy with the final product.

 - ## Full Launch at OU

At this point, we will fully launch the app and advertise to undergraduates at OU. We still intend to collect user feedback during this stage, but because of the soft launch, the app is less likely to drastically change.

 - ## Launch at other universities

 After this, we will be able to launch at other universities. At first, we intend to launch to a short list of large institutions in the midwest and southern region of the US, eventaully expanding to smaller schools and then wider regions of the US.
