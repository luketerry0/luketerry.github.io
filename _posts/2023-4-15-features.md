# A Two Way Review System

Open Thrift includes a two-way review system in which buyers and sellers rate each other if (and only if) a transaction took place. This ensures that you always know who you can trust (and who you can't). This system will make an environment where only legitimate, honest buyers and sellers will thrive.

# .edu Email Verification

Verifying with your schools email address ensures that a safe marketplace is created. You can rest assured that you are negotiating with somebody associated with your university. This layer of security also ensures that scammers and bad actors can't create multiple accounts. 

# Transaction Free Listing

The whole point of selling items is to make money, so why pay a cut of your sale to the platform? Open Thrift will be completely free for both buyers and sellers, which means you can enjoy 100% of the profit from the items you sell.
