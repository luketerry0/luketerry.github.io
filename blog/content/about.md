# About Me

Hello! Welcome to my corner of the internet. My name is Luke Terry, and currently I'm a student at the University of Oklahoma studying Computer Science. This website is intended to be a mix of many things I find interesting. In particular, I am interested in how brass-tacks programming is used to apply the power of data and mathematics to tangible problems.

Please feel free to contact me at luke dot terry0682@gmail dot com.
